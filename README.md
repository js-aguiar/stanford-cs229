# Stanford CS229 Machine Learning Models

A few machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using only Python 3 and Numpy. The implementations are
based on Stanford CS229 Lectures, which are available at [SEE](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229). The project
has a similar structure to Scikit-Learn with the fit and predict methods.

## Models

### Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression

### Generative Models:

- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

### Support Vector Machines (SVM):

- Support Vector Classifier
